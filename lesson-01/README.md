# Lesson 1 - Build a "Hello World" Docker image and run it

The task of this lesson is to write a Dockerfile to create a "Hello World" image: it prints that and exits.

- Fill the Dockerfile with the required minimal commands for that task
  - Choose a suitable base image (e.g: `ubuntu:20.04`)
  - Add the `hello.sh` file to the image and set it as the default command
- Build the image and tag it as `hello-world`
- Run the image
