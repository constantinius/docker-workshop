# Docker Workshop

This series of tasks shall help developers familiarize with Dockerfiles, images, containers and other related concepts.

In order to do these lessons, only [Docker needs to be installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Each lesson is located in its subdirectory `lesson-<n>` where `n` is the number of the lesson. There you'll find a `README.md`, detailing the purpose and the tasks of this particular lesson. Sometimes there are bonus tasks. In every lesson, there is a `.solution` directory which includes files, instructions etc that comprise a possible solution to the given tasks.
